# Ubuntu

## Prepare Ubuntu image

1. Download netinstall version of Ubuntu, e.g. [Bionic Beaver](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/)
    - e.g. `wget -r -np -R "index.html*" -P ./ http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/`
2. Modify the file `\pxelinux.cfg\default` to boot the installer with a preseeding file
    ```
    prompt 0
    timeout 0
    DEFAULT ubuntu
    
    label ubuntu
        menu label automated installation of ubuntu
        kernel ubuntu-installer/amd64/linux
        append initrd=ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz auto=true priority=critical keyboard-configuration/layout=de keyboard-configuration/variant=de preseed/file=/preseed.cfg ---
    ```
3. To automate the installation, prepare a preseeding file and copy it to the root of the file `\ubuntu-installer\amd64\initrd.gz`. You can use the [script](ubuntu/embedPreseed.sh) `embedPreseed.sh` to copy the preseed file in the `initrd.gz`.    
_e.g. execute: `sudo ./embedPreseed.sh ./initrd.gz /home/user/ubuntu_netinstall/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrdNew /home/user/ubuntu_netinstall/ubuntu-installer/amd64/preseed.cfg`_    
_Attention: The last two arguments have to be absolute paths._    
After that, delete the old `initrd.gz` and rename the new ramdisk to `Ã¬nitrd.gz` and place it into the same folder, where the old one was.    
A example preseeding file for Ubuntu 18.04 is located in this [repository](ubuntu/preseed.cfg). You have only to change [username] to the same which you defined for _ansible_ssh_user_ and [password] to the same as _ansible_ssh_pass_ in the section _[linux:vars]_ in your [hosts](../../srv/fluffi/data/polenext/projects/1/hosts) file for Polemarch. If you want to create a new one, copy all necessary data from the provided example.    

## Copy files to infrastructure
- Create a folder in `ftp.fluffi/tftp-root/`, e.g. `ftp.fluffi/tftp-root/ubuntu` and copy all Ubuntu files in the new folder:
    >&gt; __tftp-root__    
    >|&emsp;&gt; __ubuntu__    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; __pxelinux.cfg__    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; default    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; __ubuntu-installer__    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; ...    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; boot.img.gz    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; ldlinux.c32    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; ...    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; pxelinux.0    
    >|&emsp;&gt;	 __another_os__    
    >|&emsp;|&emsp;&gt; ...    
    >|&emsp;&gt; ...   
- Rename `pxelinux.0` to `pxeboot.n12`
